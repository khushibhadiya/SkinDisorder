Skin-Disorder-Prediction
Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the various classes of skin disease.

DataSet Information:- Class 1: psoriasis 2: seboreic dermatitis 3: lichen planus 4: pityriasis rosea 5: cronic dermatitis 6: pityriasis rubra pilaris Family history: 1: if any of these diseases has been observed in the family 0: otherwise Age: Represents the age of the patient All other attributes: 0: feature not present 1,2 indicate the relative intermediate values 3 indicates the largest amount possible
